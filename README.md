This directory is used to install packages for ubuntu through various dotfiles depending on what is needed 
for a new device. The three folders are for:

 vim-config - Vim configuration

 homefiles - a series of additional utilities and aliases for the .bashrc file 

 sys-installs - packages and downloadables to install on a machine

 When you clone the files, make sure you change permissions to have execution permissions
 For whichever file you use, bash will be the command to run them. 
 
 For the .bashrc edits and the software installation, you must have root priveliges.




TODOs: 
 - needs more packages to install
 - explore more aliases
 - edit vim some more
